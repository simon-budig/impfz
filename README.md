This is some testbed code for decoding and veryifing EU digital
vaccination certificates. I was interested in how the digital
certificates work and how to verify them and this is the result. I don't
make any claims regarding correctness or trustworthiness of the code, so
please feel free to use it as you like but don't blame me if it doesn't
work.  :-)

As input it expects a text file containing the raw text of the scanned
QR code.

Bye,
